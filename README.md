# ROS2_Stereo_Project

This repository is the main one for the stereo-vision project, it includes several other repositories and the files to set up the entire project

## Project Architecture
Nodes are ellipse, squares are topics and messages, unspecified arrows are ros communications, hexagones are hardware

##Â STM32 Nucleo Case

The 2 part case files are in nucleo_case

No need to clone all the repositories, they are included as submodules  
STM32_USB_Comm needs to be compiled and flashed on an stm32 using the STM32 toolchain  
Libserial will be installed by setup.sh

## Install

Run the setup :  
```bash
sudo ./misc/setup.sh
```
Build the packages :  
```bash
./misc/build.sh
```

## Execute the nodes

To execute the nodes directly do :
```bash
sudo ./run.sh
```

## Install the nodes

/!\ Under construction
To install the project do :
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```
Then you can start them and manage them as services  
To run the whole chain you can do :  
```bash
sudo systemctl start image_processing
```
/!\ Under construction

## Test commands

If you want to test some commands you can use the gui_command node :  
```bash
ros2 run gui_command gui_command
```
